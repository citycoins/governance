# CityCoins Improvement Proposals (CCIPs)

The CCIPs describe the design, implementation, and governance of the CityCoins Protocol. The CCIP process ([CCIP-000](./ccips/ccip-000/ccip-000-citycoins-improvement-proposal-process.md)) describes how to create a CCIP and get it ratified. Anyone in the CityCoins community may submit a CCIP.

## How to Get Involved

There are several ways you can get involved with the CCIP process:

- **Join the Community** - most ideas and discussions start in the [CityCoins Discord](https://chat.citycoins.co), with this repository serving as an off-chain record of the official proposals within the protocol.
- **CCIP Editor** - CCIP editors help CCIP authors make sure their CCIPs are well-formed and follow the right process. They help get CCIPs ready for review by advancing them from Draft to Accepted status. If you want to become a CCIP editor, open an issue with your name and email and ask to be added to the list of CCIP editors.
- **CCIP Reviewer** - CCIP reviewers are responsible for reviewing an Accepted CCIP using their domain expertise, and giving the author feedback to help make the SIP workable. The current considerations for a CCIP are [available in CCIP-000](./ccips/ccip-000/ccip-000-citycoins-improvement-proposal-process.md#ccip-considerations), and if you want to become a CCIP reviewer, open an issue with your name and email and ask to be added to the list of CCIP reviewers.
