## Introduction

This CCIP will define methods how to fund the City Coins DAO and how these funds can be allocated and spent.
Ongoing development to the ecosystem, future requirements, and City Coin community led and funded projects are needed to build platform stability, public awareness, and treasury income.  

## Specification

The City Coins DAO will receive 2% of the stacking rewards in STX for each PoX cycle from each city's treasury. 
  
The rewards are transferred to the DAO's treasury contract.

The rewards will be held in trust with the stacking pool operator for distribution on approved initiatives.
Inititatives must be specified in CCIP proposal form through GITHUB and voted on by stacked community vote using CCIP-015 voting mechanism. 
Proposal funding initiatives must meet the following criteria. 
1. 60 percent average of stacked votes from a defined most recent completed 2 cycles may make quorum to hold a proposed DOA CCIP vote. 
2. This may not be a future cycle as to minimize risk to manipulation. 
3. 60 percent of average votes from the defined 2 cycles must be in the affirmative (true) for passage.
4. DAO Funding Recipients must be publically known and verified by the pool operator custodian before any distributions.
5. Suspension of these voting rules may be approved for emergency initiatives with 90% of an affirmative CCIP vote at anytime.
6. todo - add on by community.

1. A user vote of stacked MIA and NYC tokens in proportional balance.
2. Averaged Stacked MIA and NYC tokens per user ID in cycle 75 and cycle 76.
3. A voting period of 1000 blocks beginning in cycle 77.
4. Funding shall commence on distribution from cycle 78. 

## Reference Implementations
