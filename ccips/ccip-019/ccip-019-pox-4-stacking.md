## Introduction

With the Stacks Nakomoto release[^1], a new version of the PoX contract `.pox-4` was released. The previous versions of the PoX contracts are used by the treasury contracts to perform delegated stacking (STX).

The CCIP-020 has disabled stacking and mining City coin tokens. However, the future of the treasury has not been finalized. There is a strong opinion in the community to liquidate the treasury. The details will be described in CCIP-022.

CCIP-022 can define to stop deelgated stacking. The treasury can be unlocked after each cycle.

Based on the uncertainty of the details in CCIP-022, this CCIP intends to:

- update .pox-3 to .pox-4 for delegated stacking in city treasury contracts in continuation of the current delegated stacking process.

## Specification

### Treasury Contracts

The current treasury contracts used with mining directly call the `.pox-3` contract, which was replaced with `.pox-4` in the Stacks 2.5 release[^1].

CCIP-019 will implement a new version of the treasury contract `ccd002-treasury-v3` that replaces `.pox-3` with `.pox-4`, as well as move the balances and perform the delegated stacking.

The pool operator send stacking rewards to a new reward-treasury contract. The community will vote on how to spend the stacking rewards in the future.

> Note: this only affects the mining treasuries for each city, the addresses for the stacking treasuries will remain the same

| City | Current                   | New                       |
| ---- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| MIA  | ccd002-treasury-mining-v2 | ccd002-treasury-mining-v3 |
| MIA  | ccd002-treasury-stacking  | _(no change)_             |
| NYC  | ccd002-treasury-mining-v2 | ccd002-treasury-mining-v3 |
| NYC  | ccd002-treasury-stacking  | _(no change)_             |

### Proposal Voting

This proposal is a continuation of the current delegated stacking process and does not require a vote.

## Backwards Compatibility

This CCIP only changes the treasury contract. All traits etc. are unchanged. The treasury continues to receive rewards.

## Activation

The CCIP would be activate via direct execution defined in CCIP-001.

## Reference Implementations

The reference implementation is published in the protocol repo[^2].
